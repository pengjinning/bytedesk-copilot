## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- **GLM-5.3 model support**: 1M context window, 128K max output tokens, always-on thinking
  - GLM-5.3 cannot disable thinking; the provider always sends `thinking.type: "enabled"` regardless of the `bytedesk-copilot.enableThinking` setting (the setting now only controls whether the thinking display is shown)
  - New `reasoning_effort` request parameter (`low` / `high` / `max`), overridable per-request via model options
  - New `bytedesk-copilot.reasoningEffort` setting: `"default"` (omit the parameter, server default is `max`), `"low"`, `"high"`, or `"max"`
  - Temperature defaults to `1.0` for GLM-5.3 per official Z.ai recommendation (other models keep `0.7`)
- Fork published under the `bytedesk-copilot` publisher to continue maintaining the extension after the upstream repository stopped updating

### Changed

- **Rebranded as `BytedeskCopilot`** (`bytedesk-copilot.bytedesk-copilot`) to distinguish from the original `ryosuke-asano.zai-vscode-chat`
- **Independent internal identifiers** so this fork can be installed and enabled alongside the original extension without conflicts:
  - Model provider vendor: `zai` → `bytedesk-copilot`
  - Commands: `zai.manage`/`zai.welcome` → `bytedesk-copilot.manage`/`bytedesk-copilot.welcome`
  - Configuration section: `zai.*` → `bytedesk-copilot.*`
  - Vision tool: `zai_analyze_image` → `bytedesk-copilot_analyze_image`

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- GLM-5.2 model support (1M context window, 128K max output tokens)
- `isUserSelectable` type definition for VS Code 1.120+ compatibility

## [0.9.1] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **Thinking display not working**: Fixed `LanguageModelThinkingPart` not being detected at runtime by adding explicit `typeof` check instead of relying on try-catch
- Restored markdown-formatted thinking display (`> 🧠 Thinking Process` quote blocks) as fallback for VS Code versions that don't support `LanguageModelThinkingPart`
- Added runtime detection (`hasThinkingPartSupport()`) to choose between native thinking part and markdown fallback
- Added proper buffer management for reasoning content in markdown fallback path

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- **Native thinking display**: Reasoning content now uses VS Code's proposed `LanguageModelThinkingPart` API for native thinking block display in Copilot Chat, instead of Markdown-formatted text blocks
- Thinking process is now streamed in real-time instead of being buffered
- Added fallback to text display when `LanguageModelThinkingPart` is not available

### Added

- `vscode.proposed.languageModelThinkingPart.d.ts` type definition for the proposed API
- `LanguageModelThinkingPart` mock for testing

## [0.8.5] - 2026-04-21

### Changed

- **MCP-first image handling**: When `zai_analyze_image` tool is available, images are analyzed via MCP instead of switching to a vision model. This eliminates token overflow caused by large base64 images in conversations with multiple images.
- Vision fallback now excludes internal models (e.g., glm-4.6v) as secondary fallback when the preferred vision model is unavailable

### Added

- Image size limit: 1 MB per image (oversized images are skipped)
- Per-message image limit: 5 images max per message
- Total image limit: 10 images max across all messages
- Placeholder text for images skipped due to size/count limits

### Fixed

- Token estimation for images now uses fixed 2000 tokens/image instead of base64-size-based estimation
- Resolved token overflow errors when pasting multiple images to non-vision models (GLM-5.1)

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed

- Token usage tracking: Now properly captures and reports prompt/completion tokens from API responses
  - Fixes: Chats showing "0 / 331K" token usage instead of actual consumed tokens
  - Tracks usage metrics through streaming response and logs token counts

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- GLM-5-Turbo model support (200K context window, 128K max output tokens)

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Reverted internal vision fallback to GLM-4.6V (some plans don't support GLM-5V-Turbo yet)
- GLM-5V-Turbo remains as a user-selectable multimodal coding model

## [0.7.4] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Replaced internal GLM-4.6V vision fallback with GLM-5V-Turbo multimodal coding model
  - GLM-5V-Turbo: 200K context window, 128K max output, vision + tool support
  - Updated vision fallback in `mcp.ts` and `provider.ts`

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- GLM-5.1 model support

## [0.6.4] - 2026-03-XX

### Added

- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
  - Automated linting, testing, and compilation checks
  - Automated release workflow for tag pushes
- ESLint Flat Config configuration (ESLint v9)
- Prettier ignore file
- Contributing guidelines
- Changelog

### Changed

- Updated `package.json` scripts for better development workflow
- Added TypeScript ESLint dependencies
- Updated lint script for Flat Config
- Improved streaming tool-call parsing to handle text-embedded tool signals and strip control tokens from visible output
- Improved OpenAI-compatible message conversion for tool-call and tool-result turns (`assistant` + `tool` role flow)

### Fixed

- Prevented internal tool-call JSON blobs from leaking into chat output in certain streaming formats
- Reduced request stalls when streams end with incomplete tool-call argument chunks
- Fixed legacy part-shape detection to avoid misclassifying tool calls as tool results

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- Updated README to reflect current model specs and troubleshooting notes

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-06

### Changed

- Added Node.js types in `tsconfig.json` to support Buffer usage
- Updated `watch` script to use `tsc -w`

### Fixed

- Prevented tool result content from inflating request size
- Added safe truncation for tool result text and improved token estimation

## [0.5.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added

- Support for GLM-4.7 and GLM-4.7 Flash (GLM-4.6V is kept internal for vision fallback)
- Tool calling support
- Streaming responses
- Vision support via GLM-OCR and internal GLM-4.6V fallback
- Thinking process display for GLM-4.7
- Detailed logging for image analysis and reasoning
- Secure API key storage using VS Code secret storage
- Command palette integration for API key management
